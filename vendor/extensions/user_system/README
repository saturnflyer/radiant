# User System

This is the standard login system for users in Radiant.
You may provide your own login system by creating an extension with the necessary features (listed below) and replace this on with:

  config.extensions = [:my_login_replacement, :all]
  config.extensions -= [:login_system]
  
## Assumptions

Radiant assumes that certain features will exist. You should provide these methods or override standard behavior accordingly.

### Routes

Radiant expects to find these route paths (and their accompanying _url methods)

  * admin_path
  * welcome_path
  * login_path
  * logout_path
  * edit_admin_preferences_path (used to link to the currently logged in user)
  
Additionally this extension provides these route paths.
  
  * admin_users_path
  * new_admin_user_path
  * edit_admin_user_path
  * remove_admin_user_path
  * admin_user_path
  * new_admin_preferences_path
  * admin_preferences_path
